> Build and deploy a serverless HTTP API on Cloudflare's global edge network using Cloudflare Workers.

## Overview

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless edge platform for running code close to users worldwide without managing servers or choosing VM regions manually. Unlike Kubernetes or Docker-based PaaS platforms, Workers uses a lightweight runtime, automatic global distribution, built-in `workers.dev` URLs, and platform bindings for configuration, secrets, and state.

**This is an Exam Alternative Lab** — Complete both Lab 17 and Lab 18 to replace the final exam.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Edge computing concepts
- Serverless deployment workflows
- Cloudflare Workers and Wrangler CLI
- Global request metadata and routing
- Secrets, environment variables, and KV persistence
- Rollbacks and observability
- Kubernetes vs Workers trade-offs

**Prerequisites:**
- Git
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Basic HTTP/JSON familiarity

**Important:** This lab does not deploy your Docker image from Lab 2. Cloudflare Workers is a serverless runtime, not a Docker host. You will build a Workers-native API that preserves similar operational concerns: routes, health checks, configuration, state, logs, deployments, and public access.

> **Regional connectivity note:** In some countries and networks, including Russia, Cloudflare services may be partially restricted. If commands such as `npx wrangler whoami` or `npx wrangler deploy` fail with vague network errors, the problem may be your network path rather than your code. If you use a VPN, prefer full-tunnel or global-routing mode. Proxy or split-tunnel setups can allow Node.js and Wrangler traffic to bypass the VPN and still hit the restricted network.

**Tech Stack:** Cloudflare Workers | Wrangler | TypeScript | Workers KV | `workers.dev`

### Task 2 — Build and Deploy a Worker API (4 pts)

**Objective:** Build a small HTTP API and deploy it to Cloudflare's edge.

**Requirements:**

1. **Implement Routes**
   - Create at least 3 HTTP endpoints
   - Include `/health`
   - Include one endpoint that returns JSON metadata about the deployment

2. **Run Locally**
   - Start local development with `npx wrangler dev`
   - Test routes in the browser or with `curl`
   - Verify correct status codes and JSON responses

3. **Deploy**
   - Deploy with `npx wrangler deploy`
   - Access the public `workers.dev` URL
   - Confirm the deployed Worker responds correctly

4. **Use Versioned Source Control**
   - Commit your Worker project to Git
   - Keep a clean deployment history you can refer to later

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

**Example route set:**
- `/` - general app information
- `/health` - health status
- `/edge` - edge metadata
- `/counter` - KV-backed persisted counter

**Minimal TypeScript example:**
```ts
export interface Env {
  APP_NAME: string;
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/health") {
      return Response.json({ status: "ok" });
    }

    if (url.pathname === "/") {
      return Response.json({
        app: env.APP_NAME,
        message: "Hello from Cloudflare Workers",
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      });
    }

    return new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
  },
};
```

**Local development:**
```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

**Expected public URL format:**
```text
https://<worker-name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

</details>

### Task 3 — Global Edge Behavior (4 pts)

**Objective:** Inspect how your Worker behaves on Cloudflare's global network.

**Requirements:**

1. **Add Edge Metadata Endpoint**
   - Return information from the incoming request context
   - Include at least `colo` and `country`
   - Include at least 1 additional field such as `asn`, `city`, `httpProtocol`, or `tlsVersion`

2. **Verify Public Edge Execution**
   - Call your deployed Worker using the public URL
   - Capture the JSON response from the metadata endpoint
   - Show evidence that Cloudflare provides request metadata at the edge

3. **Explain Global Distribution**
   - Briefly explain how Workers distributes execution globally
   - Compare this with manually choosing regions in VM or PaaS platforms
   - Explain why there is no `deploy to 3 regions` step in Workers

4. **Document Routing Concepts**
   - Explain the difference between `workers.dev`, Routes, and Custom Domains
   - Use `workers.dev` for the required deployment
   - Custom domain setup is optional

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

**Useful request metadata:**
```ts
if (url.pathname === "/edge") {
  return Response.json({
    colo: request.cf?.colo,
    country: request.cf?.country,
    city: request.cf?.city,
    asn: request.cf?.asn,
    httpProtocol: request.cf?.httpProtocol,
    tlsVersion: request.cf?.tlsVersion,
  });
}
```

**Test with `curl`:**
```bash
curl https://<worker-name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/edge
```

**Routing concepts:**
- `workers.dev` gives you a public URL quickly
- Routes attach Workers to traffic for an existing Cloudflare zone
- Custom Domains make your Worker the origin for a domain or subdomain

### Task 4 — Configuration, Secrets & Persistence (3 pts)

**Objective:** Configure your Worker with variables, secrets, and persistent state.

**Requirements:**

1. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Define at least 1 plaintext variable in `wrangler.jsonc`
   - Use it in your Worker response
   - Explain why plaintext vars are not suitable for secrets

2. **Add Secrets**
   - Create at least 2 secrets with Wrangler
   - Use the values through the `env` object
   - Do not commit secret values to Git

3. **Add Persistence with Workers KV**
   - Create a KV namespace
   - Bind it to your Worker
   - Store and retrieve at least 1 value through your API

4. **Verify Persistence**
   - Confirm the stored value still exists after a redeploy
   - Document what you stored and how you verified it

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

**Plaintext vars in `wrangler.jsonc`:**
```json
{
  "vars": {
    "APP_NAME": "edge-api",
    "COURSE_NAME": "devops-core"
  }
}
```

**Secrets:**
```bash
npx wrangler secret put API_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_EMAIL
```

**Create KV namespace:**
```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create SETTINGS
```

Add the returned namespace ID to `wrangler.jsonc`:
```json
{
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "SETTINGS",
      "id": "<your-namespace-id>"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example KV-backed counter:**
```ts
export interface Env {
  APP_NAME: string;
  API_TOKEN: string;
  ADMIN_EMAIL: string;
  SETTINGS: KVNamespace;
}

if (url.pathname === "/counter") {
  const raw = await env.SETTINGS.get("visits");
  const visits = Number(raw ?? "0") + 1;
  await env.SETTINGS.put("visits", String(visits));
  return Response.json({ visits });
}
```
