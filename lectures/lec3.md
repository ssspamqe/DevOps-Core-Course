## 📍 Slide 16 – 🎮 Section 3: GitHub Actions Hands-On

## 🕹️ Lab Preview: Build Your CI Pipeline

* 🏢 **Scenario**: You have a Python Flask app
* 🎯 **Goal**: Automate testing and Docker builds
* 📋 **Requirements**: Tests, lint, security scan, publish

**❓ How do we automate all this?**

> 🤖 **GitHub Actions** to the rescue!

🎮 **Let's build it step by step.**

---

## 📍 Slide 17 – 💥 Scenario 1: No Tests

**😰 The Problem:**
```python
# app.py
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello", "hostname": os.getenv("HOSTNAME")}

# 🚫 No tests!
```

* 📝 Code looks fine
* 💥 Deploy → crashes because `HOSTNAME` is None
* 🐛 Users see 500 errors
* 😱 Rollback emergency

> ❓ **How do we catch this before deploy?**

---

## 📍 Slide 18 – ✅ Solution: Unit Testing

## 🛠️ Fix: Write Tests First

```python
# tests/test_app.py
import pytest
from app import app

def test_home_endpoint():
    """Test that home returns expected structure"""
    client = app.test_client()
    response = client.get('/')

    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.get_json()
    assert "message" in data
    assert "hostname" in data
    assert isinstance(data["message"], str)

def test_health_endpoint():
    """Test health check"""
    client = app.test_client()
    response = client.get('/health')

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.get_json()["status"] == "healthy"
```

**🎯 Result:** Tests catch the bug before deploy!

---

## 📍 Slide 19 – 🧪 Testing Frameworks

## Python Testing Options

| Framework | 🎯 Pros | ⚠️ Cons |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **pytest** | Simple, powerful, fixtures | Extra dependency |
| **unittest** | Built-in, no dependencies | Verbose, old-style |

```bash
# 🧪 pytest (recommended)
pip install pytest
pytest tests/

# 🧪 unittest (built-in)
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

**💡 Why pytest?**
* ✅ Simple syntax (`assert` instead of `self.assertEqual`)
* ✅ Powerful fixtures (setup/teardown)
* ✅ Great plugins (coverage, parallel, etc.)
* ✅ Industry standard

---

## 📍 Slide 20 – 📝 Scenario 2: Manual Docker Builds

**😰 The Problem:**
```bash
# 🐌 Manual process every time
docker build -t myapp:latest .
docker tag myapp:latest username/myapp:v1.2.3
docker login
docker push username/myapp:v1.2.3
docker push username/myapp:latest

# 😱 Forgot to update version tag!
# 💀 Built from wrong branch!
```

* ⏱️ Takes 10 minutes
* 🎰 Inconsistent (human error)
* 📋 No validation before build
* 🤷 Can't track what version is deployed

---

## 📍 Slide 21 – ✅ Solution: GitHub Actions CI/CD

## 🛠️ Fix: Automate Everything

```yaml
# .github/workflows/python-ci.yml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest flake8

      - name: Lint
        run: flake8 app.py

      - name: Test
        run: pytest tests/
```

**🎯 Result:** Every commit automatically tested!

---

## 📍 Slide 22 – 🐳 Docker Build Automation

```yaml
  docker:
    needs: test  # ✅ Only run if tests pass
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: ./app_python
          push: true
          tags: |
            ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/myapp:latest
            ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

**🔐 Security Note:** Never hardcode credentials!

---

## 📍 Slide 23 – 🔓 Scenario 3: Vulnerable Dependencies

**😰 The Problem:**
```bash
# requirements.txt
flask==2.0.1  # 💀 Known CVE-2023-30861
requests==2.25.0  # 🔓 Security vulnerability

# 🤷 Nobody checked before deploying
```

* 🔍 **84%** of apps have vulnerable dependencies
* ⏱️ Takes **weeks** to discover
* 💀 Already in production when found

**📊 Real Example:**
* 📦 Log4Shell (2021) — **35,000+ CVE**
* 💰 Cost to remediate: **Billions of dollars**

---

      - name: Run Snyk
        uses: snyk/actions/python-3.10@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high
```

**🎯 What Snyk Does:**
* 🔍 Scans dependencies for known CVEs
* 📊 Reports severity (low/medium/high/critical)
* 🔧 Suggests fixes
* ❌ Fails build if critical vulnerabilities found

**🔐 Result:** Catch vulnerabilities before production!

---

## 📍 Slide 25 – 🐌 Scenario 4: Slow CI Builds

**😰 The Problem:**
```
[Run 1] Installing dependencies... 2 minutes
[Run 2] Installing dependencies... 2 minutes
[Run 3] Installing dependencies... 2 minutes
# 💸 Wasting 6 minutes downloading same packages!
```

* ⏱️ Each run: **5-10 minutes**
* 🔄 Re-downloading same dependencies
* 💰 Wasting CI minutes (costs money!)
* 😴 Slow feedback loop

---

## 📍 Slide 26 – ✅ Solution: Dependency Caching

## 🛠️ Fix: Cache Dependencies

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: '3.12'
    cache: 'pip'  # ✅ Enable caching
    cache-dependency-path: 'requirements.txt'

# Alternative with explicit cache
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}
```

**📊 Performance Impact:**
* ⏱️ **Before caching**: 5 minutes
* ⚡ **After caching**: 30 seconds
* 🚀 **10x faster!**

**💡 Cache Key Strategy:**
* 🔑 Key includes `requirements.txt` hash
* 🔄 Cache invalidates when dependencies change
* ✅ Fresh install when needed, cached otherwise

## 📍 Slide 28 – 🏷️ Section 4: Versioning Strategies

## 📦 How to Version Your Images?

**Two main approaches:**

**🔢 Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
* Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)
* 🎯 Use when: Breaking changes matter
* 📚 Example: Libraries, APIs

**📅 Calendar Versioning (CalVer):**
* Format: `YYYY.MM.DD` (e.g., `2024.01.15`)
* 🎯 Use when: Continuous deployment
* 🚀 Example: Web services, SaaS

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Code[📝 Code] --> SemVer[🔢 v1.2.3]
  Code --> CalVer[📅 2024.01]
  SemVer --> Lib[📚 Library]
  CalVer --> Service[🌐 Service]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 29 – 🔢 Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

## v MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

| Version | 🎯 When to Bump |
|---------|----------------|
| **MAJOR** (v2.0.0) | Breaking changes (API changed) |
| **MINOR** (v1.1.0) | New features (backward-compatible) |
| **PATCH** (v1.0.1) | Bug fixes (backward-compatible) |

```yaml
# 🏷️ Multiple tags per release
tags: |
  username/app:1.2.3
  username/app:1.2
  username/app:1
  username/app:latest
```

**✅ Pros:**
* 📖 Clear breaking change signals
* 🎯 Industry standard for libraries
* 🔄 Users can pin to major version

**⚠️ Cons:**
* 🤔 Requires discipline
* 📋 Need to track what's breaking vs feature

---

## 📍 Slide 30 – 📅 Calendar Versioning (CalVer)

## YYYY.MM.DD or YYYY.MM

| Format | 📝 Example | 🎯 Use Case |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `YYYY.MM.DD` | `2024.01.15` | Daily releases |
| `YYYY.MM.MICRO` | `2024.01.3` | Monthly + patch |
| `YYYY.0M` | `2024.01` | Monthly releases |

```yaml
# 📅 Generate version from date
- name: Generate version
  run: echo "VERSION=$(date +%Y.%m.%d)" >> $GITHUB_ENV

tags: |
  username/app:2024.01.15
  username/app:2024.01
  username/app:latest
```

**✅ Pros:**
* 📆 No ambiguity (date is date)
* 🚀 Perfect for continuous deployment
* 🧠 Easy to remember

**⚠️ Cons:**
* 🤷 Doesn't indicate breaking changes

---

## 📍 Slide 31 – 🔀 Matrix Builds

## Test Multiple Versions

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.11', '3.12', '3.13']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - run: pytest tests/
```

**🎯 What This Does:**
* 🔄 Runs tests **3 times** (one per Python version)
* ⚡ Runs in **parallel**
* ✅ Ensures compatibility across versions

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Test[🧪 Tests] --> Py311[🐍 Python 3.11]
  Test --> Py312[🐍 Python 3.12]
  Test --> Py313[🐍 Python 3.13]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 32 – 📂 Path Filters (Monorepo)

## Only Run CI for Changed Apps

```yaml
# Python CI only runs when Python code changes
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'app_python/**'
      - '.github/workflows/python-ci.yml'

# Go CI only runs when Go code changes
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'app_go/**'
      - '.github/workflows/go-ci.yml'
```

**🎯 Benefits:**
* ⚡ Faster CI (don't run unnecessary builds)
* 💰 Save CI minutes
* 🔕 Less noise (only relevant notifications)

**📊 Impact:**
* 🐌 Without filters: Every commit runs **all** CI
* 🚀 With filters: Only **affected** apps run

---

## 📍 Slide 33 – 📊 Test Coverage

## Measure What's Tested

```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    pip install pytest-cov
    pytest --cov=app_python --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term

- name: Upload to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
```

**📊 Coverage Badge:**
```markdown
![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/user/repo/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)
```

**🎯 What's Good Coverage?**
* 🥉 **60-70%** — Okay, could be better
* 🥈 **70-85%** — Good, most code tested
* 🥇 **85-95%** — Excellent coverage
* ⚠️ **100%** — Usually overkill (diminishing returns)
