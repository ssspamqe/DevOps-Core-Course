## 📍 Slide 4 – ❓ The Big Question

* 📊 **70%** of mean time to resolution is spent finding the problem
* ⏱️ Average time to detect issues: **hours to days**
* 💥 Without observability, debugging is **archaeology**

> 💬 *"Users reported it's slow... but where?"* — Every on-call engineer, ever

**🤔 Think about it:**
* How do you know your app is healthy?
* When users report issues, where do you look first?
* Can you trace a request through your system?

## 📍 Slide 6 – 🔥 Section 1: The Visibility Problem

* 🙈 **No logs** = flying blind
* 📋 Logs scattered across servers
* 🔍 grep through SSH sessions
* 💥 Result: **hours spent finding problems**

```mermaid

  Issue[🚨 Issue Reported] --> SSH1[🔌 SSH to Server 1]
  SSH1 --> Grep1[🔍 grep logs]
  Grep1 --> SSH2[🔌 SSH to Server 2]
  SSH2 --> Grep2[🔍 grep logs]
  Grep2 --> Hours[⏱️ Hours Later...]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 7 – 📋 Log Chaos

* 📁 Logs in different formats
* 🖥️ Different locations per server
* 📅 Old logs deleted or rotated
* 💀 No correlation between services

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  App1[📦 App 1: JSON logs]
  App2[📦 App 2: Plain text]
  App3[📦 App 3: Custom format]
  App1 --> Chaos[😱 No Unified View]
  App2 --> Chaos
  App3 --> Chaos
```

**📊 The Numbers:**
* 🔍 **73%** of engineers can't find logs quickly
* ⏱️ Average time to find relevant log: **15+ minutes**
* 💰 Cost of slow debugging: **$26,000/hour** (enterprise)

---

## 📍 Slide 8 – 😱 "It's Working for Me"

* 👥 Users report: *"App is slow"*
* 🤷 Team responds: *"Works for me"*
* 🔍 No data to prove either side
* 💀 Frustration all around

> ⚠️ **Without observability, you can't prove anything**

**😰 Signs of Poor Observability:**
* 🔇 "Check the server logs" (which server?)
* 📝 "It was working yesterday" (what changed?)
* 🐌 "Let's restart and see" (cargo cult debugging)
* 🚪 Blame instead of data

**💬 Discussion:** How do you currently debug production issues?

---

## 📍 Slide 9 – 🔥 The Alert Fatigue Problem

* 🚨 Too many alerts = no alerts
* 📧 Inbox full of "warnings"
* 😴 Real issues get ignored
* 💀 On-call burnout

> ⚠️ **Noise drowns out signal**

```mermaid

## 📍 Slide 10 – 💸 The Cost of Blind Operations

| 🔥 Problem | 💥 Impact |
|------------|-----------|
| 🐢 Slow debugging | Hours/days to resolve |
| 📋 No correlation | Can't trace requests |
| 👉 Finger pointing | No data, just blame |
| 🙈 Hidden failures | Issues go unnoticed |

**📈 Real Numbers:**
* 🏢 **MTTR without observability**: 4+ hours
* 🚀 **MTTR with observability**: < 30 minutes
* 💰 **ROI of observability**: 10x+ reduction in incident cost

**💰 Cost Example:**
* 💵 1-hour outage: **$300,000**
* 🔍 Good observability: **$30/month**
* 🧮 Break-even: **first 6 seconds of prevented downtime**

---

## 📍 Slide 11 – 💡 Section 2: What Observability Is

* 🔍 **Observability** = understanding system state from external outputs
* 📊 **Three pillars**: Logs, Metrics, Traces
* 🎯 Answer: "Why is this happening?"
* 🚫 NOT just monitoring (which asks "Is it working?")

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Obs[🔍 Observability]
  Obs --> Logs[📋 Logs: What happened]
  Obs --> Metrics[📊 Metrics: How much]
  Obs --> Traces[🔗 Traces: Where/how long]
```

**📖 Definition:**
> *Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its external outputs — logs, metrics, and traces.*

---

## 📍 Slide 12 – 📋 The Three Pillars

| 📊 Pillar | 🎯 Answers | 🛠️ Tools |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 📋 **Logs** | What happened? | Loki, ELK |
| 📊 **Metrics** | How much/fast? | Prometheus |
| 🔗 **Traces** | Where did time go? | Jaeger, Tempo |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Logs
    L1[📝 Error: Connection refused]
  end
  subgraph Metrics
    M1[📈 99.9% availability]
  end
  subgraph Traces
    T1[🔗 Request: 250ms total]
  end
```

**🎯 Together they tell the full story**

---

## 📍 Slide 13 – 📋 Logs: What Happened

* 📝 **Events** with timestamps
* 🔍 Detailed context for debugging
* 📊 Can be structured (JSON) or unstructured
* ⚠️ High volume, high storage

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:23:45Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "user-api",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "error": "Connection refused",
  "host": "server-1"
}
```

**🎯 Use logs when:**
* 🔍 Debugging specific errors
* 📋 Understanding request flow
* 🛡️ Security auditing

---

## 📍 Slide 14 – 📊 Why Structured Logging?

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph "❌ Unstructured"
    U1[ERROR: Failed to connect to db at 10:23]
  end
  subgraph "✅ Structured"
    S1[JSON with fields]
  end
  U1 --> Hard[😰 Hard to parse]
  S1 --> Easy[✅ Easy to query]
```

**❌ Unstructured:**
```
ERROR 2024-01-15 10:23:45 Connection to database failed on server-1
```

**✅ Structured (JSON):**
```json
{"timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:23:45Z","level":"ERROR","msg":"Connection failed","server":"server-1"}
```

**🎯 Benefits:**
* 🔍 Easy to filter and search
* 📊 Aggregate by any field
* 🤖 Machine-parseable

## 📍 Slide 21 – 🏷️ Labels: The Key Concept

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Log[📋 Log Entry] --> Labels[🏷️ Labels]
  Labels --> App[app=web-api]
  Labels --> Env[env=production]
  Labels --> Level[level=error]
  App --> Query[🔍 Query by Labels]
  Env --> Query
  Level --> Query
```

**🏷️ Labels = How Loki indexes logs**

```logql
# Query logs by labels
{app="web-api", env="production"}

# Filter errors
{app="web-api"} |= "error"
```

**⚠️ Label Best Practices:**
* 🔢 Keep cardinality low (< 10 values per label)
* 🚫 Never use high-cardinality fields (user IDs, request IDs)
* 🏷️ Use for: app name, environment, service

---

## 📍 Slide 22 – 🔍 LogQL Basics

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Selector[🏷️ Stream Selector] --> Filter[🔍 Line Filter]
  Filter --> Parser[📊 Parser]
  Parser --> Result[📋 Results]
```

**🔍 Query Structure:**
```logql
{label="value"} |= "filter" | json | field="value"
```

**📋 Examples:**
```logql
# All logs from container
{container="web-api"}

# Errors only
{container="web-api"} |= "error"

# Parse JSON, filter by level
{container="web-api"} | json | level="ERROR"

# Count errors per minute
rate({container="web-api"} |= "error" [1m])
```

---

## 📍 Slide 23 – 📊 LogQL Operators

| 🔧 Operator | 🎯 Purpose | 📝 Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `\|=` | Contains | `\|= "error"` |
| `!=` | Not contains | `!= "debug"` |
| `\|~` | Regex match | `\|~ "error\|warn"` |
| `\| json` | Parse JSON | `\| json` |
| `\| logfmt` | Parse logfmt | `\| logfmt` |
| `rate()` | Logs per second | `rate({app="x"}[5m])` |

**📊 Aggregation:**
```logql
# Logs per second by container
sum by (container) (rate({job="docker"}[1m]))

# Count by level
sum by (level) (count_over_time({app="web"} | json [5m]))
```

---

## 📍 Slide 24 – 🐍 Structured Logging in Python

```python
import logging
import json
from datetime import datetime

class JSONFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    def format(self, record):
        log_obj = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
            "level": record.levelname,
            "message": record.getMessage(),
            "logger": record.name,
        }
        if record.exc_info:
            log_obj["exception"] = self.formatException(record.exc_info)
        return json.dumps(log_obj)

# Setup
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(JSONFormatter())
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.addHandler(handler)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Usage
logger.info("User logged in", extra={"user_id": 123})
```
