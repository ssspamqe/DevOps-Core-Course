**🤔 Think about it:**
* How often does your team deploy?
* How long does a deployment take?
* Can you roll back in under 5 minutes?

---

## 📍 Slide 5 – 📝 QUIZ — DEVOPS_L6_PRE

## 📍 Slide 6 – 🔥 Section 1: The Deployment Problem

* 🎰 **Deployments = high-risk events**
* 📋 Manual steps, checklists, approval gates
* 🌙 Deploy only during "maintenance windows"
* 💥 Result: **fear of deploying**

```mermaid

  Wait --> Manual[📋 Manual Steps]
  Manual --> Pray[🙏 Hope It Works]
  Pray -->|💥 Fail| Rollback[😱 Manual Rollback]
  Pray -->|✅ Success| Relief[😮‍💨 Temporary Relief]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 7 – 💥 Deployment Failures

* 🔧 Wrong version deployed
* 📦 Missing dependencies
* ⚙️ Configuration mismatch
* 💀 Partial deployment (some servers updated, some not)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Deploy[🚀 Deploy Started] --> S1[🖥️ Server 1: ✅ Updated]
  Deploy --> S2[🖥️ Server 2: ❌ Failed]
  Deploy --> S3[🖥️ Server 3: 🔄 Pending]
  S1 --> Inconsistent[😱 Inconsistent State]
  S2 --> Inconsistent
  S3 --> Inconsistent
```

**📊 The Numbers:**
* 🔍 **60%** of outages caused by bad deployments
* ⏱️ Average recovery time: **4+ hours**
* 💰 Cost per hour of downtime: **$300,000+**

---

## 📍 Slide 8 – 😱 Rollback Nightmares

* 📋 "Just revert the code" — but what about:
  * 💾 Database migrations?
  * ⚙️ Configuration changes?
  * 📦 Dependencies?
* 🙈 No automated rollback = manual scramble
* 💀 Hours of downtime

> ⚠️ **If you can't roll back quickly, you shouldn't deploy**

**😰 Signs of Rollback Problems:**
* 🔇 "We've never actually tested rollback"
* 📝 Rollback requires manual steps
* 🐌 "Rollback takes longer than fixing forward"
* 🚪 Nobody knows the rollback procedure

---

## 📍 Slide 9 – 😨 All-or-Nothing Deploys

* 📅 Big-bang releases every few months
* 🎰 Everything changes at once
* 📋 Impossible to isolate failures
* 💀 If it fails, everything fails

> ⚠️ **Large releases = large risk**

**💬 Discussion:** Would you rather deploy 100 changes once or 1 change 100 times?

---

## 📍 Slide 10 – 💸 The Cost of Manual Deployment

| 🔥 Problem | 💥 Impact |
|------------|-----------|
| 🐢 Slow deployments | Features delayed |
| 📋 Manual errors | Outages, rollbacks |
| 👉 Inconsistent process | "Works for Alice, not Bob" |
| 🙈 Fear of deploying | Innovation stalls |

**📈 Elite vs Low Performers:**
| Metric | 🏆 Elite | 😰 Low |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Deploy frequency | Multiple/day | Monthly |
| Lead time | < 1 hour | 1-6 months |
| Change failure rate | 0-15% | 46-60% |
| Recovery time | < 1 hour | 1 week+ |

---

## 📍 Slide 11 – 💡 Section 2: Blocks & Error Handling

* 🧱 **Blocks** = group related tasks
* 🔄 **Rescue** = handle failures
* ✅ **Always** = run regardless of outcome
* 🎯 Production-ready error handling

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Block[🧱 Block] --> Try[🎯 Try Tasks]
  Try -->|✅ Success| Always[✅ Always]
  Try -->|❌ Failure| Rescue[🔧 Rescue]
  Rescue --> Always
```

---

## 📍 Slide 12 – 🧱 Block Syntax

```yaml
- name: Deploy application with error handling
  block:
    - name: Pull latest image
      docker_image:
        name: "{{ app_image }}"
        source: pull

    - name: Start container
      docker_container:
        name: "{{ app_name }}"
        image: "{{ app_image }}"
        state: started

  rescue:
    - name: Log failure
      debug:
        msg: "Deployment failed! Rolling back..."

    - name: Notify team
      uri:
        url: "{{ slack_webhook }}"
        method: POST
        body: '{"text": "Deployment failed!"}'

  always:
    - name: Cleanup temp files
      file:
        path: /tmp/deploy
        state: absent
```

---

## 📍 Slide 13 – 🛡️ Block Benefits

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "With Blocks"
    direction TD
    B1[🧱 Block] -->|❌ Fail| R1[🔧 Rescue]
    R1 --> A1[✅ Always]
  end
  subgraph "Without Blocks"
    direction TD
    T1[Task 1] --> T2[Task 2]
    T2 -->|❌ Fail| Stop[😱 Playbook Stops]
  end
```

**🛡️ Advantages:**
* 🔄 Graceful error handling
* 📊 Cleanup runs even on failure
* 🔔 Notification on failure
* 🎯 Apply settings to multiple tasks

```yaml
- name: Docker installation
  block:
    - name: Task 1
    - name: Task 2
    - name: Task 3
  become: yes        # 🔐 Applied to all tasks
  when: install_docker  # 🔀 Condition for all
  tags:
    - docker         # 🏷️ Tag for all
```

---

## 📍 Slide 14 – 🏷️ Section 3: Tags Strategy

* 🏷️ **Tags** = label tasks for selective execution
* 🎯 Run only what you need
* ⏱️ Speed up development and testing
* 🔧 Isolate specific operations

```bash
# Run only docker tasks
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "docker"

# Skip common tasks
ansible-playbook site.yml --skip-tags "common"

# List available tags
ansible-playbook site.yml --list-tags
```

---

## 📍 Slide 15 – 🏷️ Tag Design Patterns

```yaml
# roles/web_app/tasks/main.yml
- name: Application deployment
  block:
    - name: Pull image
      docker_image:
        name: "{{ app_image }}"
        source: pull

    - name: Deploy container
      docker_container:
        name: "{{ app_name }}"
        state: started
  tags:
    - app_deploy
    - deploy

- name: Application wipe
  block:
    - name: Stop container
      docker_container:
        name: "{{ app_name }}"
        state: absent
  when: web_app_wipe | bool
  tags:
    - web_app_wipe
```

**🏷️ Tag Categories:**
* 🚀 **deploy**: Deployment tasks
* 🧹 **wipe**: Cleanup tasks
* 📦 **packages**: Package installation
* ⚙️ **config**: Configuration only

---

## 📍 Slide 16 – ⚠️ Wipe Logic Pattern

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Check{🔍 web_app_wipe = true?}
  Check -->|No| Skip[⏭️ Skip wipe tasks]
  Check -->|Yes| TagCheck{🏷️ --tags web_app_wipe?}
  TagCheck -->|No| Skip2[⏭️ Skip: tag not specified]
  TagCheck -->|Yes| Wipe[🧹 Execute wipe]
```

**🛡️ Double Safety Mechanism:**
* 📊 **Variable gate**: `web_app_wipe: false` by default
* 🏷️ **Tag gate**: Must specify `--tags web_app_wipe`
* ✅ Both required to execute dangerous tasks

```bash
# Normal deploy (wipe doesn't run)
ansible-playbook deploy.yml

# Wipe only
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e "web_app_wipe=true" --tags web_app_wipe

# Clean reinstall (wipe + deploy)
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e "web_app_wipe=true"
```
